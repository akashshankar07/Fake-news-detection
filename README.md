# Fake-news-detection

Fake news Classification based on different Machine Learning Algorithms.

Contains .csv files of fake news and real news to train the model.

Data Cleaning done to remove special characters and other unnecessary characters.

Algorithms used include:

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree Classification

- Gradient Boost Classifier

- Random Forest Classifier

Different methods were used to check how accurate the model is, followed by manual testing with a given text to see if the system is able detect if its fake news or not.
